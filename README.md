**Blackjack Strategy**

  1. When the value of dealer's revealed card is 4,5 or 6, it may be fruitful to double your bet with an Ace and 4 in hand.

  2. You may want to surrender if you have 16 in your hand while the dealer has a 9,10 or A.

  3. You should always split if you have a pair of Aces.

  4. If you get a pair of 7s, only press hit if the dealer has 8,9,10 or Ace.
